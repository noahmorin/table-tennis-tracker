## TODO
- Add a visual indicator that worst elo loss and best elo gain is clickable.
- Allow any reference to name in the app be clickable to go to their profile page (in the matches tab, in the easiest/hardest opponent tab, in the recent matches tab,  etc)
- In dark mode, the background is always green, regardless of the theme colour selected. This should reflect the light theme where the background gradiant color reflects the theme color selected.
- On Mobile, doubles matches elo/win pill are cut off. Reduce the width of the  team names. The same thing happens in singles games where the player name is too long. Make sure this is reduced for both options.
- If players do not have an elo rating (or do not have any games played in the last 30 days, do not display them on the leaderboard)
-
