## TODO
- Fix best/worst opponent statline, it feels incorrectly titled. Replace with "easiest" and "hardest opponent."
- Add stat to reflect the highest elo gain and worst elo loss (determine an appropriate name for this). This should also link to the match page with that match open to see more details
- Allow any reference to name in the app be clickable to go to their profile page (in the matches tab, in the easiest/hardest opponent tab, in the recent matches tab,  etc)
- In dark mode, the background is always green, regardless of the theme colour selected. This should reflect the light theme where the background gradiant color reflects the theme color selected.
